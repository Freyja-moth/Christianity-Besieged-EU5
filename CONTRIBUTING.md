All files should begin with CB_

When creating content please ensure that each entity is kept to it's own folder to make it easier to navigate.

So for example, when making a trade goods each trade good would have it's own file, or when making advances they would be seperated by; age, religion, culture, government type, and so on.

This is not a strict ruling, nor are there any hard truths, it's mostly a matter of feeling.
