## Folder structure

All files should begin with CB_

When creating content please ensure that each entity is kept to it's own folder to make it easier to navigate.

Entities in this context refers to the largest common denominator of seperation.

So for example, when making a trade goods each trade good would have it's own file, or when making advances they would be seperated by; age, religion, culture, government type, and so on.

This is not a strict ruling, nor are there any hard truths, it's mostly a matter of feeling.

## Naming convention

All names should start with CB_

Names often appear without context, so when naming things make sure to enclude as much detail about the thing as possible

```
hre_domination
```

Could you tell that is a situation? Or that it's related to ulm in some way?

```
ulm_hre_domination_situation
```

Much better
